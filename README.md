# NetworkScienceToolkit
Full implementations of various network science algorithms. The goal is to evolve this library to a full Python package.

The deep learning philosophy in this library depends upon 

Modules (Filters) --> Layers (Parameter Initialization, Computation) --> Models (Parameters Storage, Data) --> Experiments (Data)
