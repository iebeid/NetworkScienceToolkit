The SolarSystem is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it either directly or indirectly
Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly the largest are the eight planets
Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly like the moons two are larger than the smallest planet Mercury
The SolarSystem formed 4.6billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud
The vast majority of the system mass is in the Sun with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter
The four smaller inner planets Mercury Venus Earth and Mars are terrestrial planets being primarily composed of rock and metal
The four outer planets are giant planets being substantially more massive than the terrestrials
The two largest Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium
The two outermost planets Uranus and Neptune are ice giants being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points
All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic
